    <pre>The Bharat Rashtra Samithi (transl.â€‰Indian National Council; abbr. BRS), formerly known as Telangana Rashtra Samithi (abbr. TRS), is an Indian political party which is predominantly active in the state of Telangana and currently the primary opposition party in the state. It was founded on 27 April 2001 by K. Chandrashekar Rao, with a single-point agenda of creating a separate Telangana state with Hyderabad as its capital.[15] It has been instrumental in carrying forth a sustained agitation for the granting of statehood to Telangana.[16]</pre>
